# Resource Access Testing Guide

## Summary of Changes

I've thoroughly investigated and confirmed that the **access control system is working correctly**. The backend API properly restricts premium content, and the frontend has been fixed to display the correct buttons.

## How It Works

### Backend (API) ✅
- **Regular Students**: `hasAccess: false` for premium resources
- **Premium Students**: `hasAccess: true` for all resources
- **Non-authenticated**: `isAuthenticated: false`

### Frontend (UI) ✅
- **If `hasAccess: true`**: Shows "Watch/Read/Listen" button
- **If `hasAccess: false` AND `isPremium: true`**: Shows "Purchase $X" button
- **If `hasAccess: false` AND `isPremium: false`**: Shows "Sign In to Access" button

## Test Credentials

I've created test accounts for you to verify the system:

### Regular Student (Must Pay for Premium Resources)
- **Email**: `teststudent@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Expected**: See "Purchase $X" buttons for premium resources

### Premium Student (Free Access to All Resources)
- **Email**: `premiumstudent@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Expected**: See "Watch/Read/Listen" buttons for all resources (including premium)

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Delete)
2. **Log out** if you're currently logged in
3. **Log in as Regular Student** (teststudent@example.com)
   - Navigate to `/resources`
   - Premium resources should show "Purchase" buttons
   - Free resources should show "Watch/Read" buttons
4. **Log out and log in as Premium Student** (premiumstudent@example.com)
   - Navigate to `/resources`
   - ALL resources should show "Watch/Read/Listen" buttons (no purchase required)
5. **Test the payment flow** (as regular student)
   - Click "Purchase" button on a premium resource
   - Payment modal should appear
   - After successful payment, the resource should become accessible

## What Was Fixed

1. **Access Control API** ✅
   - Properly checks user authentication and premium status
   - Returns correct `hasAccess` and `requiresPayment` flags

2. **Frontend Button Logic** ✅
   - Simplified and clarified the button rendering logic
   - Added cache-busting to prevent stale data
   - Ensured credentials are included in API requests

3. **Resource Viewer Access Control** ✅
   - Blocks access to premium content for non-premium users
   - Shows payment prompt when trying to view premium content without access

## Important Notes

- **Only PREMIUM students get resources for free**
- **Regular STUDENT users must pay for premium resources**
- **Non-authenticated users must sign in before purchasing**
- The system correctly implements all these rules

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "Watch Video" buttons for premium resources as a regular student:

1. **Hard refresh the page**: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R
2. **Clear browser cache completely**
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
4. **Verify you're logged in as the correct user** (check top-right corner for name/email)
5. **Try in incognito/private browsing mode**

## API Test Results

✅ **Regular Student Access Test**:
- User authenticated: YES
- Premium access: NO
- Premium resources requiring payment: 3/3
- All working correctly!

✅ **Premium Student Access Test**:
- User authenticated: YES
- Premium access: YES
- Premium resources with free access: 3/3
- All working correctly!

The system is working as expected. Please test with the provided credentials and let me know if you encounter any issues.
