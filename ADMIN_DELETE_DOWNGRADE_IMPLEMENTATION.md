# Admin Delete with User Downgrade Implementation

## 🎯 **What I've Implemented**

### ✅ **Enhanced Delete API**
Updated `/api/admin/mentorship/[id]/route.ts` DELETE method to:

1. **Check User Status** - Verifies if user has PREMIUM status due to mentorship payment
2. **Downgrade User** - Changes user role from PREMIUM to STUDENT
3. **Remove Subscriptions** - Deletes all premium subscriptions
4. **Clean Up Data** - Removes all related payments and appointments
5. **Delete Registration** - Finally removes the mentorship registration

### ✅ **Comprehensive Data Cleanup**
The delete process now handles:

- **User Role Downgrade** - PREMIUM → STUDENT
- **Subscription Removal** - Deletes SIGNALS and PREMIUM subscriptions
- **Payment Cleanup** - Removes all mentorship payments
- **Appointment Cleanup** - Deletes all scheduled appointments
- **Registration Deletion** - Removes the mentorship registration

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Admin Delete Process:**

1. **Admin clicks delete** on a mentorship registration
2. **System checks** if user has PREMIUM status due to mentorship payment
3. **If PREMIUM user:**
   - Downgrades user role to STUDENT
   - Removes all premium subscriptions
   - Logs the downgrade action
4. **Cleans up all data:**
   - Deletes mentorship payments
   - Deletes scheduled appointments
   - Deletes the registration
5. **Confirms deletion** with appropriate message

### **User Experience After Deletion:**

- **Loses Premium Access** - No longer has PREMIUM role
- **Loses Subscriptions** - All premium subscriptions removed
- **Can Register Again** - Can create new mentorship registration
- **Must Pay Again** - Needs to complete payment to regain premium access

## 📊 **Test Results**

if (hasPaidMentorship && isPremiumUser) {
  // Downgrade user to STUDENT
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: registration.userId },
    data: { role: 'STUDENT' }
  })

  // Remove any premium subscriptions
  await prisma.subscription.deleteMany({
    where: {
      userId: registration.userId,
      plan: { in: ['SIGNALS', 'PREMIUM'] }
    }
  })
}

// Clean up all related data
await prisma.mentorshipPayment.deleteMany({
  where: { registrationId: params.id }
})

await prisma.mentorshipAppointment.deleteMany({
  where: { registrationId: params.id }
})

// Finally delete the registration
await prisma.mentorshipRegistration.delete({
  where: { id: params.id }
})
```
