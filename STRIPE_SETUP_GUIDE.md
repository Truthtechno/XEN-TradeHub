# Stripe Payment Integration Setup Guide

## 🔧 **What I've Implemented**

✅ **Stripe Backend Integration**
- Created `lib/stripe.ts` with Stripe configuration
- Created `app/api/mentorship/create-payment-intent/route.ts` for payment intent creation
- Created `app/api/mentorship/webhook/route.ts` for payment confirmation
- Updated mentorship registration popup to use Stripe

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Complete Setup**

### 1. **Get Stripe API Keys**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Go to **Developers > API Keys**
4. Copy your **Publishable key** and **Secret key**

### 2. **Add Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_webhook_secret_here"
```

### 3. **Set Up Webhook (Optional)**
1. Go to **Developers > Webhooks** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/mentorship/webhook`
3. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`
4. Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

### 4. **Test the Integration**
1. Restart your development server
2. Try the mentorship registration flow
3. The payment will show a demo message for now

## 💳 **Current Status**

## 🎯 **What Happens Now**

2. **Payment Intent**: System creates Stripe payment intent

5. **Access**: Student gains all premium privileges

## 🔒 **Security Features**
