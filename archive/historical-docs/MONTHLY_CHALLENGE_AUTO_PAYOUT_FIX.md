# Monthly Challenge Auto-Payout Implementation

## Problem Statement

When a participant completed the Monthly Challenge (3 qualified referrals), their $1,000 prize was not automatically pushed to their affiliate account. The system required manual claiming, and even when claimed, the prize wasn't properly reflected in the affiliate earnings.

**Specific Issue:**
- Brian Amooti completed the challenge (3/3 referrals, 100% progress)
- Status showed "Completed" but Claimed Date was dormant (showing "-")
- Prize was not pushed to his affiliate account

## Root Cause

1. **No Automatic Claiming**: When the 3rd referral subscribed to copy trading, the system only incremented the referral count but didn't automatically claim the reward
2. **Missing Affiliate Earnings Update**: The claim API created a payout record but didn't update the affiliate program's `pendingEarnings` and `totalEarnings` fields

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Prize Claiming

**File:** `/app/api/copy-trading/subscribe/route.ts`

Added automatic reward claiming logic that triggers when the 3rd referral subscribes:

```typescript
// Auto-claim reward if 3 referrals reached and not yet claimed
if (progress.referralCount >= 3 && !progress.rewardClaimed) {
  try {
    await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
      // Mark challenge as claimed
      await tx.monthlyChallenge.update({
        where: { id: progress.id },
        data: {
          rewardClaimed: true,
          claimedAt: new Date()
        }
      })

      // Create payout and update affiliate earnings
      await tx.affiliatePayout.create({
        data: {
          affiliateProgramId: affiliate.id,
          amount: progress.rewardAmount,
          method: affiliate.paymentMethod || 'PENDING',
          status: 'PENDING',
          notes: `Monthly Challenge Reward - ${currentMonth} (3 qualified referrals) - Auto-claimed`
        }
      })

      // Update affiliate program earnings
      await tx.affiliateProgram.update({
        where: { id: affiliate.id },
        data: {
          pendingEarnings: { increment: progress.rewardAmount },
          totalEarnings: { increment: progress.rewardAmount }
        }
      })
    })
  } catch (claimError) {
    console.error('Error auto-claiming monthly challenge reward:', claimError)
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Manual Claim API

**File:** `/app/api/monthly-challenge/claim/route.ts`

Updated the manual claim endpoint to properly update affiliate earnings:

```typescript
// Update affiliate program earnings
await tx.affiliateProgram.update({
  where: { id: affiliateProgram.id },
  data: {
    pendingEarnings: { increment: progress.rewardAmount },
    totalEarnings: { increment: progress.rewardAmount }
  }
})
```

### 3. One-Time Fix Script

**File:** `/scripts/fix-brian-monthly-challenge.ts`

Created a script to retroactively fix Brian Amooti's account and any other users with unclaimed completed challenges.

**Execution Results:**
```
âœ… Found Brian: Brian Amooti (brian@corefx.com)
âœ… Affiliate Code: XEN-BRAM-6185
ðŸ“Š Found 1 unclaimed challenge(s):
  Month: 2025-10
  Referrals: 3/3
  Reward: $1000
  Status: Unclaimed

âœ… Reward claimed: $1000
âœ… Payout created
âœ¨ Summary:
  Total Earnings: $1637.8
  Pending Earnings: $1637.8
  Paid Earnings: $0
```

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Flow (New Behavior)

1. User A refers User B with affiliate code
2. User B signs up and subscribes to copy trading
3. System increments User A's referral count
4. **When 3rd referral subscribes:**
   - âœ… Challenge automatically marked as claimed
   - âœ… Claimed date set to current timestamp
   - âœ… $1,000 payout created with status "PENDING"
   - âœ… Affiliate `pendingEarnings` increased by $1,000
   - âœ… Affiliate `totalEarnings` increased by $1,000
   - âœ… Payout appears in affiliate dashboard immediately

### Manual Claim Flow (Fallback)

If for any reason the automatic claim doesn't trigger, users can still manually claim via:
- User page: `/copy-trading/monthly-challenge`
- API endpoint: `POST /api/monthly-challenge/claim`

The manual claim now also properly updates affiliate earnings.

## Database Changes

No schema changes required. The fix uses existing fields:

**MonthlyChallenge:**
- `rewardClaimed` - Boolean flag
- `claimedAt` - Timestamp when claimed

**AffiliateProgram:**
- `pendingEarnings` - Incremented when reward is claimed
- `totalEarnings` - Incremented when reward is claimed

**AffiliatePayout:**
- New record created with status "PENDING"
- Admin can process payout from `/admin/affiliates`
