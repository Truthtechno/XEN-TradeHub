# Notification System Fix Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Notification Count Mismatch**
**Problem:** Admin panel showed 13 notifications in the badge, but when opened, no notifications were displayed.

**Root Cause:** 
- The API route `/api/admin/activity-notifications/route.ts` was still filtering for OLD CoreFX notification types (`STUDENT_PURCHASE`, `STUDENT_ENROLLMENT`, etc.)
- The stats calculation was counting ALL notifications in the database, including USER notifications (`NEW_ACADEMY_CLASS`, etc.)
- When admin created a new academy class, it sent 13 `NEW_ACADEMY_CLASS` notifications to all students
- These user notifications were being counted in the admin notification stats, but not displayed because they don't match admin notification types

**Database State:**
```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count FROM notifications GROUP BY type;
```
Result:
- `NEW_ACADEMY_CLASS`: 13 (user notifications)
- `ACADEMY_REGISTRATION`: 1 (admin notification)

### 2. **Academy Registration Not Showing**
**Problem:** When user registered for academy class, admin didn't receive notification.

**Root Cause:**
- The notification WAS created correctly in the database
- But the admin panel wasn't displaying it because of the type filter mismatch
- The API was looking for old types, but new types were being created

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Updated Notification Type Filter
**File:** `/app/api/admin/activity-notifications/route.ts`

**Changed:**
```typescript
// OLD (CoreFX types)
type: { in: ['STUDENT_PURCHASE', 'STUDENT_ENROLLMENT', 'STUDENT_REGISTRATION', 'STUDENT_ENQUIRY', 'STUDENT_ACTIVITY', ...] }

// NEW (XEN TradeHub types)
type: { in: ['USER_SIGNUP', 'ACADEMY_REGISTRATION', 'ACADEMY_ENROLLMENT', 'BROKER_ACCOUNT_OPENING', 'COPY_TRADING_SUBSCRIPTION', 'AFFILIATE_REGISTRATION', 'AFFILIATE_REFERRAL', 'USER_ENQUIRY', 'USER_ACTIVITY'] }
```

### Fix 2: Fixed Stats Calculation
**File:** `/app/api/admin/activity-notifications/route.ts`

**Changed:**
```typescript
// OLD - Counted ALL notifications
const stats = await prisma.notification.groupBy({
  by: ['type', 'isRead'],
  _count: { id: true }
})

// NEW - Only count admin notification types
const adminNotificationTypes = ['USER_SIGNUP', 'ACADEMY_REGISTRATION', ...]
const stats = await prisma.notification.groupBy({
  by: ['type', 'isRead'],
  where: { type: { in: adminNotificationTypes } },
  _count: { id: true }
})
```

### Fix 3: Updated Validation Schema
**File:** `/app/api/admin/activity-notifications/route.ts`

**Changed:**
```typescript
// OLD
type: z.enum(['STUDENT_PURCHASE', 'STUDENT_ENROLLMENT', ...])

// NEW
type: z.enum(['USER_SIGNUP', 'ACADEMY_REGISTRATION', 'ACADEMY_ENROLLMENT', ...])
```

### Fix 4: Added Debug Logging
**File:** `/app/api/admin/activity-notifications/route.ts`

Added console logs to help debug:
```typescript
console.log('[Admin Activity Notifications] Fetching with where clause:', JSON.stringify(where, null, 2))
console.log(`[Admin Activity Notifications] Found ${notifications.length} notifications, total: ${total}`)
```

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Verify Admin Notification Count is Correct
1. **Login as Admin:** admin@corefx.com / admin123
2. **Check notification badge** in top right
3. **Expected:** Should show "1" (one ACADEMY_REGISTRATION notification)
4. **Actual:** Should no longer show "13"

### Test 2: Verify Admin Can See Academy Registration

2. **Click notification bell icon**
3. **Expected:** Should see "üìö New Academy Registration" notification
4. **Message:** "BRIAN AMOOTI (brayamooti@gmail.com) registered for academy class: 'Premium Training'"

### Test 3: Create New Academy Registration

### Test 4: Test Other Admin Notifications
Create test scenarios for each notification type:

### Test 5: Verify User Notifications Still Work

```

## Console Logs to Monitor

When testing, check the browser console and server logs for:

[Admin Activity Notifications] Fetching with where clause: {
  "type": {
    "in": ["USER_SIGNUP", "ACADEMY_REGISTRATION", ...]
  }
}
[Admin Activity Notifications] Found 1 notifications, total: 1
```

This confirms the API is:
1. Filtering correctly
2. Finding the right notifications
3. Returning accurate counts
