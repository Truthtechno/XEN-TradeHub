# Affiliate Pending Earnings Fix

## Problem

When a payout was marked as COMPLETED, the `pendingEarnings` field was going **negative** instead of staying at **$0.00**.

### Example
- Affiliate has `totalEarnings: $10.00` and `pendingEarnings: $10.00`
- Admin creates a payout for $10.00 (status: PENDING)
- Admin marks payout as COMPLETED
- **Bug**: `pendingEarnings` becomes **$-10.00** ‚ùå
- **Expected**: `pendingEarnings` should be **$0.00** ‚úÖ

## Root Cause

The issue was a **double decrement** of `pendingEarnings`:

1. **First Decrement** (Payout Creation):
   - When creating a payout, the system decremented `pendingEarnings` by the payout amount
   - File: `/app/api/admin/affiliates/payouts/route.ts` (line 71-73)

2. **Second Decrement** (Payout Completion):
   - When marking payout as COMPLETED, the system decremented `pendingEarnings` again
   - File: `/app/api/admin/affiliates/payouts/[id]/route.ts` (line 58-60)

This resulted in: `pendingEarnings = $10 - $10 - $10 = $-10` ‚ùå

## Solution

### 1. Remove Decrement from Payout Creation

**File**: `/app/api/admin/affiliates/payouts/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
// Create payout
const payout = await prisma.affiliatePayout.create({
  data: {
    affiliateProgramId: affiliateId,
    amount,
    method,
    notes,
    status: 'PENDING'
  }
})

// Update affiliate program pending earnings
await prisma.affiliateProgram.update({
  where: { id: affiliateId },
  data: {
    pendingEarnings: {
      decrement: amount  // ‚ùå This was causing the issue
    }
  }
})
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Create payout (don't decrement pendingEarnings yet - that happens when status becomes COMPLETED)
const payout = await prisma.affiliatePayout.create({
  data: {
    affiliateProgramId: affiliateId,
    amount,
    method,
    notes,
    status: 'PENDING'
  }
})
// ‚úÖ No decrement here - it happens only when payout is completed
```

### 2. Add Safeguard to Prevent Negative Values

**File**: `/app/api/admin/affiliates/payouts/[id]/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
if (status === 'COMPLETED' && currentPayout.status !== 'COMPLETED') {
  await tx.affiliateProgram.update({
    where: { id: currentPayout.affiliateProgramId },
    data: {
      paidEarnings: {
        increment: currentPayout.amount
      },
      pendingEarnings: {
        decrement: currentPayout.amount  // ‚ùå Could go negative
      }
    }
  })
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (status === 'COMPLETED' && currentPayout.status !== 'COMPLETED') {
  // Get current affiliate data to ensure pendingEarnings doesn't go negative
  const affiliate = await tx.affiliateProgram.findUnique({
    where: { id: currentPayout.affiliateProgramId },
    select: { pendingEarnings: true }
  })

  // Calculate new pending earnings (ensure it doesn't go below 0)
  const newPendingEarnings = Math.max(0, (affiliate?.pendingEarnings || 0) - currentPayout.amount)
  
  await tx.affiliateProgram.update({
    where: { id: currentPayout.affiliateProgramId },
    data: {
      paidEarnings: {
        increment: currentPayout.amount
      },
      pendingEarnings: newPendingEarnings  // ‚úÖ Never goes below 0
    }
  })
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Correct Flow

1. **Affiliate Earns Commission**:
   - `totalEarnings: $10.00`
   - `pendingEarnings: $10.00`
   - `paidEarnings: $0.00`

2. **Admin Creates Payout** (status: PENDING):
   - Payout record created
   - **No change to pendingEarnings** ‚úÖ
   - `pendingEarnings: $10.00` (still)

3. **Admin Marks Payout as COMPLETED**:
   - `paidEarnings` increases by $10.00
   - `pendingEarnings` decreases by $10.00 (but never below 0)
   - Final state:
     - `totalEarnings: $10.00`
     - `pendingEarnings: $0.00` ‚úÖ
     - `paidEarnings: $10.00` ‚úÖ

### Edge Case Handling

If somehow `pendingEarnings` is less than the payout amount:
```typescript
// Example: pendingEarnings = $5, payout = $10
const newPendingEarnings = Math.max(0, 5 - 10)  // = 0 (not -5)
```

This ensures `pendingEarnings` can never be negative.

## Data Fix Script

For existing affiliates with negative pending earnings, run:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/fix-negative-pending-earnings.ts
```

**What it does**:
1. Finds all affiliates with `pendingEarnings < 0`
2. Sets their `pendingEarnings` to `0`
3. Leaves `paidEarnings` and `totalEarnings` unchanged
4. Logs all changes

**Example Output**:
```
üîç Checking for affiliates with negative pending earnings...

‚ö†Ô∏è  Found 1 affiliate(s) with negative pending earnings:

üìã Affiliate: BRIAN AMOOTI
   Code: BRIAN-REF-2025
   Current Pending: $-10.00
   Paid Earnings: $10.00
   Total Earnings: $10.00

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Normal Payout Flow
1. Affiliate has `pendingEarnings: $50.00`
2. Create payout for $50.00
3. Mark as COMPLETED
4. **Expected**: `pendingEarnings: $0.00`, `paidEarnings: $50.00` ‚úÖ

### Test Case 2: Partial Payout
1. Affiliate has `pendingEarnings: $100.00`
2. Create payout for $50.00
3. Mark as COMPLETED
4. **Expected**: `pendingEarnings: $50.00`, `paidEarnings: $50.00` ‚úÖ

### Test Case 3: Multiple Payouts
1. Affiliate has `pendingEarnings: $100.00`
2. Create payout #1 for $30.00
3. Create payout #2 for $40.00
4. Mark payout #1 as COMPLETED
5. **Expected**: `pendingEarnings: $70.00`, `paidEarnings: $30.00` ‚úÖ
6. Mark payout #2 as COMPLETED
7. **Expected**: `pendingEarnings: $30.00`, `paidEarnings: $70.00` ‚úÖ

### Test Case 4: Edge Case (Payout > Pending)
1. Affiliate has `pendingEarnings: $10.00`
2. Create payout for $50.00 (admin error)
3. Mark as COMPLETED
4. **Expected**: `pendingEarnings: $0.00` (not negative) ‚úÖ

## Files Modified

1. **Payout Creation API**: `/app/api/admin/affiliates/payouts/route.ts`
   - Removed premature `pendingEarnings` decrement
   - Added comment explaining the logic

2. **Payout Update API**: `/app/api/admin/affiliates/payouts/[id]/route.ts`
   - Added safeguard to prevent negative values
   - Uses `Math.max(0, ...)` to ensure non-negative result

3. **Data Fix Script**: `/scripts/fix-negative-pending-earnings.ts` (NEW)
   - Finds and fixes existing negative values
   - Provides detailed logging

## Benefits

### For Affiliates
- ‚úÖ Accurate pending earnings display
- ‚úÖ No confusing negative values
- ‚úÖ Clear view of what's been paid vs what's pending

### For Admins
- ‚úÖ Correct financial tracking
- ‚úÖ No data inconsistencies
- ‚úÖ Reliable payout processing

### For System
- ‚úÖ Data integrity maintained
- ‚úÖ No negative values in database
- ‚úÖ Proper accounting logic

## Prevention

The fix includes multiple layers of prevention:

1. **Timing**: Decrement only happens when payout is completed
2. **Safeguard**: `Math.max(0, ...)` prevents negative values
3. **Transaction**: All updates happen atomically
4. **Logging**: Console logs for debugging

## Status

‚úÖ **FIXED** - Pending earnings will never go negative again

**Changes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Removed double decrement
- ‚úÖ Added safeguard for negative values
- ‚úÖ Created data fix script
- ‚úÖ Documented the fix

**Next Steps**:
1. Run the data fix script to correct existing data
2. Test the payout flow with the new logic
3. Monitor for any edge cases

The system now correctly handles pending earnings, ensuring they stay at $0.00 (or positive) and never go negative!
