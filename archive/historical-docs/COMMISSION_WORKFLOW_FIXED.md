# Commission Workflow - Complete Overhaul ✅

## Problem Identified

**Issue 1:** Commissions were being created but not showing in affiliate earnings  
**Issue 2:** No admin control over when commissions are approved  
**Issue 3:** Need verification workflow before awarding commissions

## New Workflow Implemented

### **Status-Based Commission Approval**

Instead of creating commissions immediately, the system now uses a **status-based workflow** where admin verification triggers commission creation and approval.

```
User Action → Status: PENDING → Admin Verifies → Status: ACTIVE → Commission Created & Approved
```

## Copy Trading Workflow

### **User Flow**
1. User subscribes to copy trading
2. Subscription created with **status: PENDING**
3. Admin receives notification

### **Admin Flow**
1. Go to `/admin/copy-trading`
2. See subscription with **PENDING** status
3. Verify deposit was made
4. Change status from **PENDING** to **ACTIVE** using dropdown
5. **Commission automatically created and approved**
6. Affiliate earnings updated immediately

### **Status Options**
- **PENDING** - Awaiting admin verification (default for new subscriptions)
- **ACTIVE** - Verified and active (triggers commission)
- **PAUSED** - Temporarily suspended
- **CANCELLED** - Terminated

### **Commission Trigger**
```javascript
// When admin changes status from PENDING → ACTIVE:
1. Calculate commission (investment × commission rate)
2. Create commission record (status: APPROVED)
3. Update affiliate earnings immediately
4. Mark referral as CONVERTED
5. Show success message
```

## Broker Account Workflow

### **User Flow**
1. User opens broker account
2. Account opening created with **status: PENDING**
3. Admin receives notification

### **Admin Flow**
1. Go to `/admin/brokers`
2. See account opening with **PENDING** status
3. Verify account was opened
4. Change status from **PENDING** to **APPROVED** using dropdown
5. **Commission created (pending deposit verification)**
6. Admin later updates commission with actual deposit amount

### **Status Options**
- **PENDING** - Awaiting admin verification (default)
- **APPROVED** - Account verified (creates commission placeholder)
- **REJECTED** - Account rejected

### **Commission Trigger**
```javascript
// When admin changes status from PENDING → APPROVED:
1. Create commission with $0 amount
2. Status: PENDING (requires deposit verification)
3. Admin must later update amount in commission panel
4. Then approve commission to update earnings
```

## Academy Registration Workflow

### **User Flow**
1. User registers for academy class
2. Registration created

### **Admin Flow**
No action needed - **auto-approved**

### **Commission Trigger**
```javascript
// Immediately upon registration:
1. Calculate commission (class price × commission rate)
2. Create commission record (status: APPROVED)
3. Update affiliate earnings immediately
4. Mark referral as CONVERTED
```

## Changes Made

### 1. **Copy Trading Subscription Endpoint**
**File:** `/app/api/copy-trading/subscribe/route.ts`

**Before:**
```javascript
status: 'ACTIVE'  // Immediately active
// Commission created immediately
```

**After:**
```javascript
status: 'PENDING'  // Awaits admin verification
// No commission created yet
```

### 2. **Copy Trading Status API**
**File:** `/app/api/admin/copy-trading/subscriptions/[id]/status/route.ts`

**New endpoint** that:
- Updates subscription status
- Creates and approves commission when PENDING → ACTIVE
- Updates affiliate earnings
- Marks referral as converted

### 3. **Copy Trading Admin Page**
**File:** `/app/(admin)/admin/copy-trading/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
<Badge>{sub.status}</Badge>
<Button>Pause</Button>
<Button>Cancel</Button>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<Select value={sub.status} onValueChange={updateStatus}>
  <SelectItem value="PENDING">PENDING</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="ACTIVE">ACTIVE</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="PAUSED">PAUSED</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="CANCELLED">CANCELLED</SelectItem>
</Select>
```

### 4. **Broker Account Status API**
**File:** `/app/api/admin/brokers/account-openings/[id]/status/route.ts`

**New endpoint** that:
- Updates account opening status
- Creates commission placeholder when PENDING → APPROVED
- Commission requires deposit amount update

### 5. **Broker Admin Page**
**File:** `/app/(admin)/admin/brokers/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
<Badge>{opening.status}</Badge>
<Button>Approve</Button>
<Button>Reject</Button>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<Select value={opening.status} onValueChange={updateStatus}>
  <SelectItem value="PENDING">PENDING</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="APPROVED">APPROVED</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="REJECTED">REJECTED</SelectItem>
</Select>
```

## API Endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Commission not created
**Check:**

2. Is user referred? (has referredByCode)
3. Is affiliate active? (isActive = true)
4. Check server logs for errors

### Issue: Earnings not updated
**Check:**
1. Was commission approved?
2. Check commission status (must be APPROVED)
3. Refresh affiliate dashboard

### Issue: Dropdown not working

2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API endpoint exists
4. Check network tab for API response

## Next Steps
