## Database Query

The API fetches commissions using:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  amount,
  type,
  description,
  status,
  createdAt,
  verifiedAt
FROM "AffiliateCommission"
WHERE "affiliateProgramId" = '[affiliate-id]'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
```

## Summary Statistics Calculation

```javascript
// Total Commissions
const total = affiliateCommissions.length

// Approved Amount
const approved = affiliateCommissions
  .filter(c => c.status === 'APPROVED')
  .reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.amount, 0)

// Pending Amount
const pending = affiliateCommissions
  .filter(c => c.status === 'PENDING')
  .reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.amount, 0)
```

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Additions:**
1. **Export to CSV** - Download commission breakdown
2. **Date Range Filter** - Filter by date range
3. **Search** - Search by description
4. **Sorting** - Sort by date, amount, type, status
5. **Pagination** - For affiliates with many commissions
6. **Referred User Column** - Show who generated the commission
7. **Commission Details** - Click row to see full details
