# Syntax Error Analysis

The error points to line 215 (`<div className="space-y-6...">`) saying "Expected jsx identifier".

This error typically means one of these issues:

1. **Missing closing brace `}` before the return statement**
2. **Missing closing parenthesis `)` in a function call**
3. **Unclosed JSX tag somewhere above**
4. **Invalid JSX syntax in a conditional**

## What I Need to Check:

Run this command to see the exact content around line 212-215:
```bash
sed -n '206,220p' app/\(admin\)/admin/reports/page.tsx
```

This will show if there's any hidden character or syntax issue I'm missing.

## Possible Fix:

The issue might be that the component function is missing something. Let me verify the complete structure is:

```tsx
export default function ReportsPage() {
  // ... all the hooks and state
  
  // ... all the functions
  
  if (isLoading) {
    return (...)
  }
  
  return (
    <div>...</div>
  )
}
```

If there's a missing `}` anywhere in the functions above, it would cause this error.
