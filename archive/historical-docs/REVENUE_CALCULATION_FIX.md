# Revenue Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** Total revenue showed $342.00 instead of expected $232.00

**Root Cause:** The revenue calculation was including ALL affiliate commissions ($110) regardless of payment status, not just the paid ones.

## Investigation Results

Database query revealed:
```sql
order_revenue:     $0    (no completed orders)
academy_revenue:   $232  (confirmed registrations)
affiliate_paid:    $0    (no paid commissions)
affiliate_total:   $110  (pending commissions)
```

**Calculation was:**
```
Total Revenue = $0 (orders) + $232 (academy) + $110 (all affiliates) = $342
```

**Should have been:**
```
Total Revenue = $0 (orders) + $232 (academy) + $0 (paid affiliates) = $232
```

## Solution Applied

### Changed Revenue Calculation

**Before:**
- Included ALL affiliate commissions (paid + pending)
- This inflated revenue by $110

**After:**
- Only includes PAID affiliate commissions
- Accurately reflects actual received revenue

### Code Changes

**File:** `/app/api/admin/reports/simple/route.ts`

1. **Renamed variables for clarity:**
   - `affiliateCommissions` → `affiliatePaidCommissions`
   - `affiliateRevenue` → `affiliateTotalCommissions`

2. **Updated revenue calculation:**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const totalRevenueAmount = totalRevenue + academyRevenue + affiliateRevenue
   
   // After
   const totalRevenueAmount = totalRevenue + academyRevenue + affiliatePaidCommissions
   ```

3. **Updated affiliates data:**
   ```typescript
   affiliates: {
     totalAffiliates: affiliatePrograms,
     commissions: affiliatePaidCommissions,  // Only paid
     revenue: affiliateTotalCommissions      // Total (for reference)
   }
   ```

## Result

### Before Fix:
- **Total Revenue:** $342.00 ❌
  - Orders: $0
  - Academy: $232
  - Affiliates (all): $110

### After Fix:
- **Total Revenue:** $232.00 ✅
  - Orders: $0
  - Academy: $232
  - Affiliates (paid): $0

### Affiliate Breakdown:
- **Paid Commissions:** $0
- **Pending Commissions:** $110
- **Total Commissions:** $110

## What This Means

### Revenue (Actual Money Received):
- ✅ Academy registrations: $232 (confirmed)
- ✅ Affiliate commissions: $0 (none paid yet)
- ✅ **Total Revenue: $232**

### Pending (Not Yet Paid):
- ⏳ Affiliate commissions: $110 (awaiting payment)

## Impact on Reports

### Main Reports Page:
- **Total Revenue card:** Now shows $232 ✅
- **Academy Revenue card:** Still shows $232 ✅
- **Affiliates card:** Shows $0 paid, $110 total

### Revenue Report Export:
- Only includes actual received revenue
- Academy registrations: $232
- No affiliate revenue (none paid yet)

### Affiliates Report:
- Shows total commissions: $110
- Shows paid commissions: $0
- Clearly distinguishes between pending and paid

## Why This Matters

### Financial Accuracy:
- Revenue should only reflect money actually received
- Pending commissions are liabilities, not revenue
- Proper accounting separation

### Business Decisions:
- Accurate revenue for financial planning
- Clear visibility of pending obligations
- Better cash flow management

## Verification

To verify the fix:

1. **Check Total Revenue:**
   - Should show $232 (not $342)

2. **Check Revenue Breakdown:**
   - Academy: $232 ✅
   - Affiliates (paid): $0 ✅

3. **Check Affiliate Details:**
   - Total commissions: $110
   - Paid commissions: $0
   - Pending: $110

## Database State

Current affiliate commissions in database:
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*), SUM(amount) 
FROM affiliate_commissions 
GROUP BY status;

Result:
status    | count | sum
----------|-------|-----
PENDING   |   ?   | $110
PAID      |   0   | $0
```

These $110 in pending commissions will become revenue once they are marked as PAID.

## Files Modified

- `/app/api/admin/reports/simple/route.ts` - Fixed revenue calculation logic

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

Total revenue now accurately reflects only received money ($232 from academy), not pending obligations ($110 in affiliate commissions).
