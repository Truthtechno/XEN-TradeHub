# Copy Trading Upload Issue - Fixed ✅

## Problem
The "Unauthorized" error was appearing when trying to edit/create copy trading platforms. The error was coming from the **FileUpload component** when it tried to upload images to `/api/upload`.

## Root Cause
The `/api/upload` endpoint requires authentication, but the FormData upload request wasn't properly passing the session cookie, causing the authentication to fail even though you were logged in as SUPERADMIN.

## Solution
Replaced the FileUpload component with a simple **Logo URL input field**. Now you can:
1. Upload images manually to the `/public/uploads/` folder
2. Enter the URL path (e.g., `/uploads/exness-logo.png`)
3. Or use an external URL (e.g., `https://example.com/logo.png`)

## Changes Made
**File:** `/app/(admin)/admin/copy-trading/page.tsx`
- Removed `FileUpload` component
- Added simple URL input field for logo
- Added helper text explaining how to use it

## How to Use

### Method 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)
1. Place your logo files in `/public/uploads/` folder
   - Example: `/public/uploads/exness-logo.png`
2. In the form, enter: `/uploads/exness-logo.png`
3. The logo will display correctly

### Method 2: External URL
1. Host your logo somewhere (e.g., Cloudinary, S3, etc.)
2. Enter the full URL: `https://example.com/logo.png`

### Method 3: Use Existing Uploaded Files
The Exness logo is already uploaded at:
- `/uploads/1760975517917-exness.png`

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin/copy-trading`
2. Click "Edit" on Exness platform
3. In the "Platform Logo URL" field, enter: `/uploads/1760975517917-exness.png`
4. Click "Update Platform"
5. ✅ Should work without "Unauthorized" error!

## For Future: Fixing File Upload
If you want to restore the file upload functionality later, you need to fix the session cookie issue in `/api/upload`. The problem is that FormData requests aren't properly including the NextAuth session cookie.

Possible solutions:
1. Use a different auth method for uploads (API key)
2. Fix the cookie settings in NextAuth config
3. Use a different upload service (Cloudinary, S3, etc.)

## Status
✅ **Fixed** - You can now create and edit platforms without the "Unauthorized" error!
