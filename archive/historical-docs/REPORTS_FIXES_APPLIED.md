### 4. ⚠️ Academy & Affiliates Charts Showing No Data
**Problem:** Charts are rendering but showing empty/no data despite engagement existing in the system.

**Possible Causes:**
1. API returning empty arrays for chart data
2. Database queries not finding data due to date range filters
3. Data structure mismatch between API response and chart expectations
4. Authentication issues preventing data fetch

**Debugging Added:**
- Added console logging to `fetchAllChartData()` function
- Logs will show array lengths for each chart type

**To Investigate:**
1. Open browser console on `/admin/reports` page
2. Check console logs for "Chart Data Fetched:" message
3. Verify which charts have 0 length arrays
4. Check network tab for API responses
5. Verify database has data within the selected date range

## Database Verification Queries

Run these to check if data exists:

```sql
-- Academy Data
SELECT COUNT(*) as classes FROM academy_classes;
SELECT COUNT(*) as registrations FROM academy_class_registrations;
SELECT COUNT(*) as confirmed FROM academy_class_registrations WHERE status = 'CONFIRMED';
SELECT SUM(amountUSD) as revenue FROM academy_class_registrations WHERE status = 'CONFIRMED';

-- Affiliates Data
SELECT COUNT(*) as programs FROM affiliate_programs;
SELECT COUNT(*) as active FROM affiliate_programs WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
SELECT COUNT(*) as commissions FROM affiliate_commissions;
SELECT SUM(amount) as paid FROM affiliate_commissions WHERE status = 'PAID';

-- Enquiries Data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM enquiries;
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending FROM enquiries WHERE status = 'PENDING';
SELECT COUNT(*) as resolved FROM enquiries WHERE status = 'RESOLVED';
```
