2. System creates commission with requiresVerification: true
   ↓
3. Verification data stored (investment amount, subscription ID, etc.)
   ↓
4. Admin reviews at /admin/affiliates/commissions
   ↓
5. Admin verifies deposit/investment proof
   ↓
6. Admin approves or rejects with reason
   ↓
7. On approval:
   - Commission status → APPROVED
   - Affiliate earnings updated
   - Referral status → CONVERTED
```
