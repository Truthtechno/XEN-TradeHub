   - Toast notifications working

2. **User Dashboard** (`/affiliates` when registered) - ✅ WORKING

   - Displays earnings (Total, Pending, Paid Out)
   - Shows referral count
   - Displays tier and commission rate

## 📋 What Still Needs Enhancement

The admin dashboard currently shows basic information but needs to display:

### In Affiliates Table:
- ❌ Phone numbers (data exists in DB but not displayed)
- ❌ Payment methods (data exists but not displayed)
- ❌ Full names from registration (using user.name instead)

### In Payouts Table:
- ❌ Phone numbers
- ❌ Account numbers
- ❌ Account names  
- ❌ Provider/Bank information

## 🎯 Next Steps

To add the missing information display:

1. **Update TypeScript Interfaces** to include:
   - `fullName`, `phone`, `paymentMethod`, `payoutDetails` in AffiliateProgram
   - Full affiliate details in AffiliatePayout

2. **Add Table Columns**:
   - "Contact & Payment" column in Affiliates table
   - "Contact & Payout Info" column in Payouts table

3. **Add Icons**:
   - Phone icon for phone numbers
   - Wallet icon for payment methods

## 📁 Files Status

- ✅ `/app/(authenticated)/affiliates/page.tsx` - User registration (WORKING)
- ✅ `/app/(admin)/admin/affiliates/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard (WORKING, needs enhancement)

## Current Issue

The page was showing blank because of a React error from incomplete edits. 
**Solution**: Restored working version. Page should now load correctly.

**Status**: System is functional. Enhancement for displaying contact/payout details can be added incrementally.
