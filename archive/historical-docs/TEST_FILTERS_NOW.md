## Step 1: Run This Command

**Copy and paste into terminal:**

```bash
PGPASSWORD=password psql -h localhost -U postgres -d xen_tradehub -c "UPDATE users SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM users ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 3); UPDATE users SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '15 days' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM users ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3); UPDATE users SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '45 days' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM users ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 3 OFFSET 6); UPDATE academy_class_registrations SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM academy_class_registrations LIMIT 1); SELECT 'SUCCESS!' as status, COUNT(*) as total_users, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days') as last_7_days FROM users;"
```

**Expected output:**
```

## 🐛 If Nothing Changes

1. **Check browser console (F12):**
   - Look for: `🔄 Date Range Changed: 7d`
   - Any errors?

2. **Check server terminal:**
   - Look for: `📅 Date Range Received: 7d`
   - Any errors?

3. **Verify SQL ran:**
   ```bash
   PGPASSWORD=password psql -h localhost -U postgres -d xen_tradehub -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days') FROM users;"
   ```
   Should return: `3`

4. **Clear cache and try again:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   # Hard refresh browser
   ```
