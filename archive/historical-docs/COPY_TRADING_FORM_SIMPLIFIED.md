## Seeded Data Status

✅ **Data is in the database!**

The seed script successfully created:
- **Exness** platform (Active)
- **HFM** platform (Active)

To see the platforms:
1. Restart your dev server if it's running
2. Navigate to `/admin/copy-trading`
3. The platforms should now appear in the table

If you still don't see them, try:
```bash
# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

Then refresh the page at `http://localhost:3000/admin/copy-trading`

## Files Modified

1. `/app/(admin)/admin/copy-trading/page.tsx`
   - Removed 5 form fields
   - Updated table to show only 5 columns

2. `/app/api/admin/copy-trading/platforms/route.ts`
   - Updated validation
   - Set default values for removed fields

## Testing

To verify everything works:

1. ✅ Navigate to `/admin/copy-trading`
2. ✅ You should see Exness and HFM platforms
3. ✅ Click "Add Platform" - form should only show simplified fields
4. ✅ Create a new platform with just the required fields
5. ✅ Edit an existing platform - should work without the removed fields

## Next Steps

1. Upload actual logos for Exness and HFM
2. Update the copy trading links with your tracking URLs
3. Test creating a new platform
4. Test the user-facing page at `/copy-trading`
