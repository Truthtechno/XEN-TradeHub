# Monthly Challenge - Affiliate Payout Integration ✅

## Overview

Updated the Monthly Challenge feature to automatically create an affiliate payout request when a user completes the challenge (3 qualified referrals) and claims their $1,000 reward.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Payout Creation

**File:** `/app/api/monthly-challenge/claim/route.ts`

**What Happens When User Claims Reward:**

1. ✅ **Validates User Has Affiliate Account**
   - Checks if user has registered as an affiliate
   - Returns error if no affiliate account exists
   - Prompts user to register at `/affiliates`

2. ✅ **Creates Payout Request**
   - Amount: $1,000 (from `rewardAmount` field)
   - Status: `PENDING`
   - Method: User's preferred payment method
   - Notes: "Monthly Challenge Reward - YYYY-MM (3 qualified referrals)"

3. ✅ **Uses Database Transaction**
   - Ensures both challenge claim and payout creation happen together
   - Prevents data inconsistency
   - Rolls back if either operation fails

### 2. Updated User Experience

**File:** `/app/(authenticated)/copy-trading/monthly-challenge/page.tsx`

**New Features:**

1. ✅ **Affiliate Account Notice**
   - Shows warning card if user doesn't have affiliate account
   - Provides "Register as Affiliate" button
   - Explains requirement clearly

2. ✅ **Updated Success Message**
   - Shows: "Your $1,000 reward has been added to your pending payouts"
   - Directs users to check Affiliates page
   - Confirms payout was created successfully
