# Affiliate Registration Issue - Fixed

## Problem
User was logged in and could see the dashboard, but the affiliate registration was showing "Unauthorized" error.

## Root Cause
NextAuth session was not being properly detected on the client side, even though the user was authenticated and could access other protected routes.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Authentication Check
- Removed the redundant session check that was blocking access
- The page is already in the `(authenticated)` folder, so Next.js middleware handles auth
- Users don't need to be checked again on the client side

### 2. Added Session Credentials
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to the fetch request
- This ensures cookies are sent with the API request
- NextAuth uses HTTP-only cookies for session management

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added specific error message for 401 (session expired)
- Better user feedback with toast notifications
- Console logging for debugging

### 4. Added Toast Provider
- Added `<Toaster />` component to `/components/providers.tsx`
- Now users will see visual feedback for success/error messages
- Configured with proper styling and duration

## How It Works Now

1. **User is already authenticated** - They can see the dashboard and navigation
2. **User clicks "Register as Affiliate"** - Form opens
3. **User fills form and submits** - Data is validated client-side
4. **API request is made** - With credentials included
5. **Server validates session** - Using NextAuth
6. **Registration completes** - User sees success toast
7. **Page refreshes data** - Shows affiliate dashboard with referral link

## Testing Steps

1. Make sure you're logged in (you can see the dashboard)
2. Go to `/affiliates`
3. Click "Register as Affiliate"
4. Fill in all required fields:
   - Full Name
   - Phone Number
   - Payment Method (Mobile Money selected)
   - Account Number
   - Account Name
   - Provider (for Mobile Money)
5. Click "Complete Registration"
6. You should see:
   - Success toast notification
   - Form closes
   - Page shows your affiliate dashboard
   - Your unique referral code and link

## If Still Getting "Unauthorized"

This means the session cookie is not being sent or recognized. Try:

1. **Hard refresh the page**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)
2. **Clear browser cache and cookies** for localhost
3. **Check browser console** for any errors
4. **Verify you're logged in**: Check if you can access `/dashboard`
5. **Try logging out and back in**: This refreshes the session

## Technical Details

### Session Flow
```
Browser → /api/affiliates/register
  ↓
NextAuth checks session cookie
  ↓
If valid: Process registration
If invalid: Return 401
  ↓
Client handles response
  ↓
Show success/error toast
```

### Files Modified
- `/app/(authenticated)/affiliates/page.tsx` - Removed auth check, added credentials
- `/components/providers.tsx` - Added Toaster component
- `/app/api/affiliates/register/route.ts` - Already has proper session validation

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Registration should now work seamlessly for logged-in users
