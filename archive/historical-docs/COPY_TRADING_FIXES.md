# Copy Trading System - Fixes Applied

## Issue
The copy trading pages on both admin and user panels were showing old data and not reflecting the new enhanced features.

## Root Cause
After updating the Prisma schema with new fields and models, the Prisma Client was not regenerated, causing TypeScript type mismatches and the application to use outdated schema definitions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Regenerated Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
This regenerated the Prisma Client with all the new fields and models:
- Enhanced MasterTrader fields (username, bio, profitShareRate, broker, roi, winRate, maxDrawdown, totalProfit, totalTrades)
- Enhanced CopyTradingSubscription fields (copyRatio, stopLossPercent, profit tracking, trade counts)
- New CopyTrade model
- New ProfitShare model

### 2. Restarted Development Server
Killed and restarted the Next.js dev server to pick up the new Prisma Client changes.

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
Added a submenu structure for Copy Trading in the sidebar:
- **Copy Trading** (parent menu)
  - Browse Traders (view all traders)
  - My Traders (view your subscriptions)

**Features added:**
- Expandable/collapsible menu with chevron icons
- Active state highlighting for submenus
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile-responsive
